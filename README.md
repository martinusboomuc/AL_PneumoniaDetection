# Active Learning for Pneumonia Detection  

This repository contains the **code, report, and visualizations** for the **Active Learning framework** applied to pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to **optimize dataset labeling** by implementing an **Active Learning strategy** for training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is designed to improve classification accuracy while reducing the need for extensive labeled data.  

## Available Files  
- **`ActiveLearningPneumoniaDetection.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.  
- **`Project-AI-MEI-2024154464.pdf`** – Report detailing the methodology, implementation, and results.  
- **`Data and Results/`** – Contains images and visualizations related to data distribution, model performance, and Active Learning progression.  

**The dataset is NOT provided in this repository** due to licensing restrictions.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow, Keras**  
- **Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
